        <div>The div element provides a way to identify a block of content that can be styled by CSS specified in the style element.</div>
        
        <p>Without the style element, a div would be indistinguishable from a paragraph within the body of an HTML document. However paragraphs like this aren't automatically styled unless specified in the style element.</p>
       <span>Spans</span>
       <span>are not block</span>
       <span>of text</span>
       <span>so they remain</span>
       <span>inline without wrapping like DIVs</span>
       <div><p>You can even put a <span>span</span> inside of a div if there is something inside requiring <span>special styling</span></p></div>
